# car_simulator

Simple top-down 2D car simulator made in C++ using box2D for physics and SFML for rendering.

This project is to dust off my C++ knowledge and get practice developing a Software 1.0 simulator to better understand it
(the [Chestertons's Fence](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Chesterton%27s_Fence)).

It is pretty barebones and not that interesting right now, so don't get that excited.
